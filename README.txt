##Catalog App

A basic catalog app built with Flask, sqlalchemy, sqlite. Users can optionally create an account via Google+ signin. Unauthenticated users can still browse the catalog by selecting a column. This shows the items in that category. Clicking on an item will show details about that item. Authenticated users can create items with various data fields like, price, description, title, sku, image url etc. Authenticated users can also create new categories. Users can edit the items and categories that they create. 


### How to run:

To run the app, you must have python installed:
1. from the shell, navigate to the catalog root dir.
2. type: python catalog.py    to launch
3. In your browser, navigate to localhost at port 8000
